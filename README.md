# CRUD project
## Introduction
### Abstract:
In this CRUD project we have created different web pages by the help of which we can create, read, delete and update the data of people from the database which is present in our computer.

#### What Is CRUD?
CRUD stands for create, reade, update and delete various data present from the database which is provided to us. In CRUD project we have connected our database which is present in our computer with our web pages to provide a better interface to us or our user so they can use it easily without learning any NoSQL or SQL commands to create, reade, update and delete the data from the database.

## Technologies Used
### Express.js
Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js, released as free and open-source software under the MIT License. It is designed for building web applications and APIs. It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js.

### MongoDB
MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License which is deemed non-free by several distributions.

### Node.js
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on a JavaScript Engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, which was designed to build scalable network applications.

### Code Editor
#### VS Code
Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS.Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionality.

## Problem Statement & Solution
CRUD operations in simple SQL and NoSQL are confusing and can be very tiresome for a person to do all those operation in a database. In CRUD project we have connected our database which is present in our computer with our web pages to provide a better interface to us or our user so they can use it easily without learning any NoSQL or SQL commands to create, reade, update and delete the data from the database.

## Conclusion & Future Work
 CRUD project we have connected our database which is present in our computer with our web pages to provide a better interface to us or our user so they can use it easily without learning any NoSQL or SQL commands to create, reade, update and delete the data from the database. We can work on this project to make it more interactive and more user friendly.
